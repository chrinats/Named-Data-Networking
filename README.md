# Named-Data-Networking
Large scale impact analysis on Big Data Packet Size in Named Data NetwÎ¿rking, using ndn-Simulator.
A dumbell topology was used for research purposes, with variable data packet size and transmission delay.In addition, various queuing policies have been used.Simulations were performed on the ndn-sim. 
The topology is located below:

 C1                P1
   \              /
    \+--+    +--+/
     |R1|----|R2|
    /+--+    +--+|\
   /              \
 C2                P2
